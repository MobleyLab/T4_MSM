# T4_MSM

### Description
The following directory contains all simulation files and code to reproduce our work, "Characterizing Discrete Binding Conformations of T4 L99A via Markov State Modeling".  

### Organization
#### Overall layout
Associated code and files for different procedures are separated into distinct directories, outlined below. Each level of organization also contains a separate `README.md` file that better details what can be found.

#### Manifest:
- `simulation_files`: starter files to reproduce simulations 
- `MSM_notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks to build MSMs for different protein--ligand systems
- `figures`: directory of PDFs of all figures in the main text
- `SI_figures`: directory of PDFs of all figures in the Supporting Information

### Requirements
The content here relies primarily on open-source tools and we provide files to reproduce the environment we used to run the analyses. Some materials require an OpenEye license, which is free for academics.
